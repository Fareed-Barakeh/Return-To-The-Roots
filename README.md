# Return-To-The-Roots
ReturnToTheRoots is a Python-based linguistic analysis tool designed to process Arabic verbs and generate their complete set of morphological derivatives. By taking a single verb as input, the system applies root extraction and morphological generation techniques to produce all possible derived forms, which are output to a .txt file for reference or further linguistic research.

# Upcoming: 
the project is being expanded to include a graphical visualization of the output in the form of a fractal tree, where each branch represents a different derivational pathway — visually mapping the richness and complexity of Arabic morphology.

# Advanced AI/NLP Integration
The next phase of ReturnToTheRoots integrates state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing methods to improve both accuracy and scope:
Morphological Analysis with Neural Models — Leveraging transformer-based language models (e.g., AraBERT, CAMeLBERT) for precise segmentation and part-of-speech tagging.
Root Extraction Optimization — Combining rule-based triliteral/quadriliteral root extraction with deep-learning-based pattern recognition.
Derivation Prediction — Using sequence-to-sequence models to predict rare or unconventional derivatives not covered by static rules.
Semantic Grouping — Clustering derivatives based on meaning similarity using word embeddings (e.g., fastText, AraVec).
Error Correction — Applying AI-driven spell-checking and morphological disambiguation to handle irregular input.

# Potential Applications
Linguistic Research — Assisting researchers studying Arabic morphology, dialects, and etymology.
Language Learning Tools — Helping learners visualize how words evolve from a single root.
Cultural Heritage Preservation — Digitally mapping historical and modern Arabic lexical structures.
Creative Writing — Generating diverse word forms for literary or poetic composition.

# Planned Features
Export derivatives in multiple formats (TXT, CSV, JSON).
Interactive fractal tree visualization with zoom and filtering.
API endpoints for integration into other linguistic platforms.
Multi-dialect support.
